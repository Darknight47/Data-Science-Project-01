    "**Description:** The project focuses on developing and evaluating dynamic pricing models for retail. It compares traditional statistical methods like ARIMA with ensemble learning techniques, such as Random Forests. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Problem:** Traditional models often struggle with complex data patterns and large datasets. The problem is to determine whether advanced ensemble learning techniques can outperform traditional time-series models in predicting optimal prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies for Dynamic Pricing:\n",
    "1. **Rule-Based Pricing:** Setting prices based on predefined rules like competitor prices, stock levels, or markdown schedules. Works well as a baseline for both model types.\n",
    "2. **Demand Forecasting:** Predicting future demand to adjust prices dynamically, commonly used in time-series models.\n",
    "3. **Elasticity-Based Pricing:** Adjusting prices based on the estimated price elasticity of demand, often implemented using ensemble models for non-linear relationships.\n",
    "4. **Optimization-Based Pricing:** Using optimization algorithms to maximize revenue or profit by integrating model predictions with constraints like inventory and competitor prices.\n",
    "5. **Context-Aware Pricing:** Leveraging additional factors like seasonality, promotions, or customer behavior, often better captured by ensemble models due to their feature flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences in Strategies:\n",
    "1. **Time-Series Models:** Focus on temporal patterns and demand forecasting, relying heavily on historical sales and seasonality trends.\n",
    "2. **Ensemble Models:** Incorporate broader feature sets (e.g., competitor prices, customer ratings) and excel in capturing complex, non-linear relationships, making them suitable for context-aware and elasticity-based pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "This dataset provides synthetic yet realistic data for analyzing and forecasting retail store inventory demand. It contains over 73000 rows of daily data across multiple stores and products, including attributes like sales, inventory levels, pricing, weather, promotions, and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Date: Daily records from [start_date] to [end_date].\n",
    "2. Store ID & Product ID: Unique identifiers for stores and products.\n",
    "3. Category: Product categories like Electronics, Clothing, Groceries, etc.\n",
    "4. Region: Geographic region of the store.\n",
    "5. Inventory Level: Stock available at the beginning of the day.\n",
    "6. Units Sold: Units sold during the day.\n",
    "7. Demand Forecast: Predicted demand based on past trends.\n",
    "8. Weather Condition: Daily weather impacting sales.\n",
    "9. Holiday/Promotion: Indicators for holidays or promotions."
