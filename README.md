# Data Science Project 01

## Project One: Time Series Prediction (JetRail_Traffic)
Unicorn Investors wants to make an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed!
The investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 million monthly users with in next 18 months.
In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, we need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months.
We are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.

<h2 style="color: #f03c15"> Project Two: Classification (credit_score_classification) </h2>
Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness.
It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness.

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1. Good   
2. Standard  
3. Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.

## Project Three: Time Series Prediction (daily_female_birth)
Forecasting the number of daily female birth based on the path data!

## Project Four: Price Prediction (diamonds_price_analysis)
How much does a diamond cost?

## Project Five: Sale Prediction (ecuador_prediction)
We will predict sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador.

## Project Six: Data Cleaning Exercise (exercise_datacleaning)
Data Cleaning Exercise, Different ways of cleaning a dataset!

## Project Seven: Linear Regression with interaction effects (linear_regression_with_interaction)
Estimating a linear regression model with annual income in USD (earn) as the response variable. Investigating whether the relationship between income earn and level of education education differs depending on gender male or not.

## Project Eight: Loan Prediction (loan_prediction)
Will the loan application be approved?

## Project Nine: Logistic Regression (logistic_regression)
The task is to examine the relationship between a number of predictors and whether a family chooses to switch to a well with lower arsenic content (switch = "yes") or not (switch = "no").

## Project Ten: Time Series Prediction (website_performance)
To analyze and optimize web traffic and user engagement!
