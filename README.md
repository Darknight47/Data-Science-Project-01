## Project 01 
### Time Series Prediction (JetRail_Traffic) ⌛
Unicorn Investors wants to make an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed!
The investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 million monthly users with in next 18 months.
In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, we need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months.
We are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.

## Project 02 
### Classification (credit_score_classification) ⬆️⬇️
Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness.
It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness.

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1. Good   
2. Standard  
3. Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.

## Project 11
### Dynamic Pricing Model (dynamic_pricing_strategy) 💲💱🏷️
Build a dynamic pricing model that incorporates the number of rides, number of drivers, location category, customer loyalty status and other features of the following dataset to predict optimal fares for rides in real time.

## Project 12
### Dynamic Pricing Strategies (Ensemble Learning Model vs. Time Series Model) (dynamic_pricing_strategy2) 💲💱🏷️
Research Problem: Traditional models often struggle with complex data patterns and large datasets. The problem is to determine whether advanced ensemble learning techniques can outperform traditional time-series models in predicting optimal prices.
