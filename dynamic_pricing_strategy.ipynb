    "## Dynamic Pricing Strategy from a Data Science Perspective\n",
    "Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting prices for products or services based on demand, supply, competition, and other external factors in real-time or near real-time.  \n",
    "It relies heavily on data science techniques, machine learning, and optimization algorithms to maximize revenue, profit, or market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Dynamic Pricing\n",
    "1. **Elasticity of Demand:** The relationship between price and demand. Understanding how demand changes in response to price adjustments is central to dynamic pricing.\n",
    "2. **Market Segmentation:** Dividing the customer base into segments based on behavior, willingness to pay, or other factors. Dynamic pricing can be tailored for each segment.\n",
    "3. **Competition Analysis:** Monitoring competitorsâ€™ prices and adjusting your own pricing strategy accordingly.\n",
    "4. **External Factors:** Variables such as time, weather, events, or economic conditions that impact customer purchasing behavior."
